# Parking-Space-Classifier

This project is a simple machine-learning pipeline designed to classify parking spaces as either empty or not empty using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. It preprocesses image data, trains an SVM classifier, performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, and saves the best model for future use.
